# Seattle-Reign-Project
The Seattle Reign FC began play in the then eight-team National Women's Soccer League in 2013, the leagueâ€™s inaugural season. During their first season, Reign FC played at Starfire Stadium in Tukwila, WA. In February 2014, the team moved to Memorial Stadium, located at the Seattle Center. The Reign is looking to increase ticket sales and attendance. The team has seen past successes and has featured a star-powered roster, but recently is not doing as well and has fewer big-name players. The Reign is still looking to generate additional interest in the community. As an outside consultant I will help them achieve the following objectives: Research Questions Question 1: Understand the merchandise buying preferences and average expenditure over the 2016 season for people who have attended 2016 season.  First examine the buying preferences of people who have attended the match in 2016 season Examine merchandises that are popular and sell at store, online and during match with and without promos  Question 2: Which type of ticket sells the most and at what timings of the day fans like to attend the match?  First examine the ticket preferences of people who are planning to attend matches in season 2017 Examine which timings are popular when people would like to attend the matches in season 2017 and buy a season ticket
